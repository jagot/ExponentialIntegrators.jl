Linear differential equations (LDEs) of the kind
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  uₜ = L(t)u
#+END_EXAMPLE
has the solution
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  u(t) = 𝒰(t,0)u(0)
#+END_EXAMPLE
where =𝒰(t,0)= is the /propagator/ that takes =u= from time =0= to
time =t=. The propagator can formally be written as
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  𝒰(t,0) = exp[∫_0^t dt L(t)].
#+END_EXAMPLE
In practice, the propagator is approximated via time-stepping:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  𝒰(t,0) = exp(Lₙ)exp(Lₙ₋₁)...exp(L₁),
#+END_EXAMPLE
where =Lᵢ= is an approximation of the integral of the operator =L=
over the time interval =[(i-1)Δt,iΔt]=, where =Δt= is the time-step.

Usually, =L= can be written as a sum of many operators:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
L = A + B + C + D ...
#+END_EXAMPLE
We may then further approximate =exp(Lᵢ)= by exponentiating the
sub-operators separately, and arranging them in such a way that the
error introduced by this /splitting/ is minimized. A classical example
is the so-called /Strang splitting/, in which
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
exp[Δt(A+B)] = exp(B/2) exp(ΔtA) exp(ΔtB/2) + 𝒪{exp(Δt³[A,B])},
#+END_EXAMPLE
where =[A,B]≝AB-BA= is the /commutator/ between =A= and =B=, which is,
in general, non-zero.
